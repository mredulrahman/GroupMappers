            The study aimed to determine the subnational proportion of the population in
            Bangladesh that can access COVID-19 testing, treatment, and ICU facilities within
            1-3 hours of travel time. The AccessMod open-source package was used to estimate
            these indicators during the dry season in 2020. The results highlight areas where
            populations have limited physical access to COVID-19-related health services, and
            the government should conduct further analyses to improve access. The study also
            emphasizes the need for regular updates to account for changes in the COVID-19
            health services delivery network.
