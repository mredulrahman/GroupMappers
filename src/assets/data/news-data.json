It is web-based, open-access tool empowers us to conduct diagnostic network and route optimization analysis for any disease, aligning diagnostic networks with national health goals and supporting universal health coverage efforts.\n\nIn low- and middle-income countries, basic diagnostic capacity is available in just 1% of primary care clinics and 14% of hospitals. Through Optidx, decision makers can now work towards expanding access, enhancing efficiency and managing costs effectively.\n\nEquipped with this knowledge, GroupMappers,MORU is ready to share the expertise and experience in improving diagnostic capacity of HIV, Malaria, TB and other diseases in Bangladesh, India, Pakistan, South Africa, Zambia, Kenya, USA, Vietnam.",
