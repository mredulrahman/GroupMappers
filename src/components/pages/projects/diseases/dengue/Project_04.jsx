          The aim of this project was household-level dengue data collection. Mobile-based data
          collection platform KoBoToolBox was used in this project. This data was used to tackle
          the dengue outbreak in Dhaka city. The surveyed site was selected based on the output
          of dengue drone survey. A total of 182 houses were surveyed, with 40 of them having
          dengue patients.
