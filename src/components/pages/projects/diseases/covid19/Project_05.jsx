            The study conducted in Bangladesh during the COVID-19 pandemic used real-time mobility data from Facebook to analyze the impact of travel restrictions and social distancing on the spread of the virus. The study aimed to assess the effectiveness of spatially and temporally variable enforcement of social distancing on COVID-19 spread. The findings showed that the population of Bangladesh fluctuated during major events throughout the year, and the COVID-19 case count rose and fell in correspondence with these events. This indicates that travel restrictions and social distancing measures had an impact on the spread of COVID-19. The study suggests that real-time population mapping using Facebook data can be a useful tool for analyzing the effectiveness of pandemic mitigation responses.
