The survey was carried out with the help of an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). Pix4DMappers processed the UAV data in three major steps (pre-processing, Point Cloud Generation, and Digital Surface Model (DSM)-Orthophoto Generations). The process of data collection encompassed the following: Flight planning, Image acquisition and processing, and digitization of features using geospatial analysis. High-resolution imageries were at the center of this data hub and different survey methods eg. mobile applications, online surveys, community engagement, or participatory approaches were applied. Focuses on the findings: Discarded tyres, Flower pot/Rooftop agriculture, Open water tanks, Polythenes, Open reservoirs on the roof, Air conditioners, Others important habitats. Collected data is stored and manipulated in an integrated dashboard system. A simple web application is developed which provides standard mapping interface features eg. online query or search, reporting, statistical representation, zooming and panning to a particular area, and identification of the features.</p>
