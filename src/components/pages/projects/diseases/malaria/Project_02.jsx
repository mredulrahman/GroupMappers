          <strong>Diagnostic Network Optimization Analysis: A project in collaboration with ICCDR,B to analyze diagnostic network for G6PD testing for malaria treatment in Southeastern part of Bangladesh.</strong><br />
          <p className='py-2'>FIND, ICDDR,B, and our team collaborated on an initiative to evaluate the G6PD testing network for malaria treatment in the southeastern region of Bangladesh using accessmod.</p>
          <p className='py-2'>Our aim was to develop a plan to introduce G6PD testing, increasing access for patients with P. vivax malaria while making efficient use of available resources.</p>
          <p className='py-2'>Two types of data were used for the project-geospatial and tabular. In geospatial data the coordinate of labs and source sites are needed. Then the test demands source wise and a HF master list with details is prepared in an excel template provided by OptiDx.</p>
          <p className='py-2'>Through simulations, we determined the optimal strategy for extensive G6PD testing. This is critical because certain antimalarial drugs can cause severe hemolysis in G6PD-deficient individuals, and P. vivax malaria is common in areas where G6PD deficiency is prevalent.</p>
